 - Improve algorithm for deciding which triangles to not render.
    Currently the top face is rendered when camera is between top and bottom face in height
    (Renders a triangle which should be backface culled)
 - 
 - Add minimum light level, so that mesh triangles never can be completely black

***bugs***
 - rect in torus_and_cone.obj starts to dissapear when viewpoint is only at z=-2


*potential improvements*
 - add functionality to print stuff like fps and triangles being rendered to the bottom-most line
