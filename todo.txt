 - Switch 'fill_char' triangle field to 'normal', which could just be a Point (vector)
 - Calculate normals for each triange
 - Add lighting direction field to renderer struct, and parameter to new function
 - Use lighting direction and triange normal to calculate light intensity per triange, not per fragment
 - Add spinning effect
 - Add mouse controls

***bugs***
 - rect in torus_and_cone.obj starts to dissapear when viewpoint is only at z=-2
