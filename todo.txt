 - Add ability to rotate camera
 - Add minimum light level, so that mesh triangles never can be completely black
 - Add mouse controls

***bugs***
 - rect in torus_and_cone.obj starts to dissapear when viewpoint is only at z=-2


*potential improvements*
 - add functionality to print stuff like fps and triangles being rendered to the bottom-most line
